# Sensor City Delft
Repository for the sensor platform code.

All examples are based on the Pycom Lopy.

![Workflow](https://github.com/rbraggaar/sensor-city-delft/blob/master/assets/workflow.PNG)

Example folders contain a basic boot.py besides the main modules. 
This way folder contents can be transferred to a Lopy to get a working example.
For a customized boot.py script you can have a look at the `custom_wlan_server` folder.
